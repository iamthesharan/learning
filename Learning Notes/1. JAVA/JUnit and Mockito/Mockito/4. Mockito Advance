@Mock - Automatically creates mock but for this you need @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) -  Adding it over the class will run all the class with Mockito JUnit Runner.
                                    Mockito JUnit Runner makes sure that all the mocks are created and dependeny mocks are injected.

@InjectMocks -  This Annotaion is used to inject mocks on the mentioned class.

    Ex:

        TodoServiceImpl todoServiceImpl = new TodoServiceImpl(todoServiceMock); // here todoServiceMock is a mock object.
        So to shorten this line we can use.

        @InjectMocks
        TodoServiceImpl todoServiceImpl; // This will check whatever is the injecting parameter in the constuctor of TodoServiceImpl, if the Mock object is available for that, Mockito will inject it.

@Captor - Will create Captor for the mentioned line.

    Ex:
        @Captor
        ArgumentCaptor<String> stringArgumentCaptor;


If we want to use 2 Junit Runner like Spring JUnit Runner as well as Mockito JUnit Runner,
Then we cannot use it together on @RunWith annotation. 
Instead we have to use @Rule annotation

@Rule
public MockitoRule mockitoRule = MockitoJUnit.rule();
