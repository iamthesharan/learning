Test suites are used to group the test cases.
Suppose you have a class with lots of test cases which takes a lots of time to execute. and your requirement is to execute only some of the test cases from that class.
In that case you can use test suite.

@RunWith(Suite.class)
@SuiteClasses({
    QuickBeforeAfterTest.class,
    StringHelperTest.class
})
public class AllTest{

}
