                                                                            Beans are ready to use.
                                                                                    |
                                                                                    |
                                Your Custom destroy method<-------------- Container is shutdown after the applications ends
                                
                                
                                
                                
You can add customer Codes during Bean Initilization:
*Calling Customer bussiness Logic methods
*Setting up handles to resource(db, sockets, file etc)



You can add customer Code during bean Distruction:
*Calling Custom business logic methods
*Clean up handles to resource(db, sockets, file etc)



So during bean initialization and distruction you can add codes and this is called Hooks


Init method configuration:

	<bean id="myCoach" class="com.spring.ioc.CricketCoach" init-method="doMyStartupStuff">
	</bean>                                                                    |
                                                                                   |    
                                                                        Method to be defined in bean
                                                                        
                                                                        
Destroy method Configuration:


<bean id="myCoach" class="com.spring.ioc.CricketCoach" destroy-method="doMyClenupStuff">





Development process:

1. define a method for int and destroy
2. Configure a method in Spring Config file



Special Note: Defining init and destroy methods - Method Signatures
Special Note about init and destroy Method Signatures

When using XML configuration, I want to provide additional details regarding the method signatures of the init-method  and destroy-method .

Access modifier
The method can have any access modifier (public, protected, private)

Return type
The method can have any return type. However, "void' is most commonly used. If you give a return type just note that you will not be able to capture the return value. As a result, "void" is commonly used.

Method name
The method can have any method name.

Arguments
The method can not accept any arguments. The method should be no-arg.
