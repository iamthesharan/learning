What is Spring Auto Wiring.

1. For Dependency Injection Spring can use auto wiring

    For Dependency Injection Spring can automatically wire ups the dependency Injection

2. Spring will look for a class that matches the given Property
    
    It will Actaully Match the type : class or interface
    
3. Spring will inject it Automatically ... hence it is called autowiring    


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spring will scan all the  @Components and will say it needs to satisfy Dependencies.Is there anyone who implements the fortune Service? It needs to inject a fortune Service
So Spring Will ask that is there any class that implements FortuneServices Interface
If it exist then spring will grab that bean and actually inject it

As of Spring Framework 4.3, an @Autowired annotation on such a constructor is no longer necessary if the target bean only defines one constructor to begin with. However, if several constructors are available, at least one must be annotated to teach the container which one to use.
