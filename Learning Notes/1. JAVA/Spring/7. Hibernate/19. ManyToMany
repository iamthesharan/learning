Example for Many to Many Association is Reader and Book.
A Book Can have multiple Readers.
A Readers can read Multiple Books.

It is very Imp to Understand the Association betweent the two Entities. You should Carefully Choose the Managing Entity and the Entity Which is managed by.
The Managing entity Should Containt @JoinTable Annotation.
Note.** If the association is by Dir. and you arte trying to add the Data from the Inverse Side , then the Join Table data will not be populated.
where if you try to add the Data from the Managing side. Then only Join table data will be Populated.

Here we have made the Book entity as our managing Entity.

    So inside book entity we will have 	
    
    @ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
	@JoinTable(name="reader_books", joinColumns = {@JoinColumn(referencedColumnName = "id")}, inverseJoinColumns = {@JoinColumn(referencedColumnName = "id")})
	List<Reader> readers;


    And Inside Managable Entity:

    @ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy = "readers")
	List<Book> books;
