Strictfp- Strict Floating Point
/*
	Came in 1.2 verison
	where we can apply :
	  1) in classes
	  2) in  method
	  3) but not for variable
*/

/*

We can use strictfp for classes and methods but not for variables  

*/

/*
	Suppose we are taking:
		System.out.println(10/3);
		o/p---> In 16bit Computer we get -----> 3.3333 upto 5 to 6 decimal
				In 64 bit Computer we get ----> 3.3333333333333 upto 14 to 15 decimal
		
		So platform to platform result will change.
		
		
	So If we want platform independent results for floating point arithmetic
	then we should go for strictfp modifier.
	
	Strictfp Method:
	
	
		strictfp public void m1(){
			SOP(10/3);----------->  ##All Floating point has to follow IEEE754 Standard if the 
										Method is strictfp.
		}
		
		
*/


/*
	strictfp method always ask for implementation but Abstract does not.
	So There is an illegal combination between abstract and Strictfp.	
	
*/



/*
	Strictfp class
	
	class test{
		m1(){}
		m2(){}
		m3(){}
		m4(){}
		m5(){}
		
		## in every concrete method requires strictfp.
	}
	
	Solution : add strictfp class.
	
	
	But Suppose if a class contains abstract method then class must also be abstract
	
	but here Abstract and Strictfp can come together if it is a class.
	no matter the method inside abstract class is abstract or not.
