Each key value pair is called entry.

Since entry is always part of MAP hence Entry interface is a child interface of map and is defined inside the Map Interface (inner Interface)


Mehods in Entry Interface. it is used of each entry only and not for whole Map.
these are entry Specific methods and can be applied on entry object.

interface Map{
    interface Entry{
        Object getKey();
        Object getValue();
        Obejct setValue(Object newValue);  // returns old Value
    }
}


Undelying data Structure for HashMap is HashTable.
insertion order is not preserved and is based on Hashcode of keys.
key can be null but only once
values can be null any number of time
Heterogeneous keys are allowed for both key and value
implements Serializable, Clonable, but not RandomAccess.
