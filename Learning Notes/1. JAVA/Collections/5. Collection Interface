Collection Interface Defines the most Common Methods which are applicable for any Collection Object.
collection Object Can be, ArrayList, LinkedList, etc

Genralized Methods Present in Present in Collection Objects.

1.      boolean add(Object O) --> Adding an Object
2.      boolean addAll(Collection C) --> It takes Parameter as group Collection Object.  Ex. l.addAll(x)
3.      boolean remove(Object O) -->removing a Single Object
4.      boolean removeAll(Collection C) --> Removing a group of Objects
5.      void clear()--> for removing the all the Objects from the Collection Object. after clear(), size of the Collection will become 0
6.      boolean retainAll(Collection C) --> Except the Group of objects present in C. All the objects will be removed.
7.      boolean contains(Object O) -->Checks whether this object is Present in the Collection or not.
8.      boolean containsAll(Collection C) -> Checks whether this group of objects are present or not.
9.      boolean isEmpty() --> Checks whether the Collection is Empty or not.
10.     int size() --> return size of the Collection.
11.     Object[] toArray()-> Returns the Collection into Array. (For better performance we Use Array).

Example:
If we Want to remove all the Evening Batch people from Collection. User removeAll(Collection eveningBatch)



For getting the objects from Collection, we need Cursor.
The Universal Cursors are:
1. Iterator --> (Applicable for all Collection Objects) --> Iterator iterator()

There is no Concrete class which implements Collection Interface Directly
