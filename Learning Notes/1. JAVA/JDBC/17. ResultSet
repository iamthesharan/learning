ResultSet is the CursorSet

by default Result Set is pointing towards BFR.
BFR: Before First Record.
AFR: After Last Record


ResultSet interface contain various Methods:
rs.getInt();
rs.getDouble();
rs.getString();

rs.getXxx(String Column);
rs.getXxx(int Column);

In JDBC index always starts with 1.


For Huge amount of rows use Column Index --> Since comparison of name will decrease performance
For less Amount of rows use Column name.

rs.findColumn(String columnName);

ResultSet follows Iterator Design Pattern




--------------------------------------------------

Statement st=con.createStatement();
ResultSet rs1=st.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM EMP");
ResultSet rs2=st.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM STUDENTS"); --> HERE THE rs1 will get closed after this statement

When we try to open new Result Set with the same statement object, previous resultSet will get Closed.
