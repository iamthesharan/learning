JDBC API defines several classes and interfaces that is require for JDBC application

JDBC API:

Programmers can use this API to develop JDBC Application
Driver Software vendor can use this API to develop driver Software

JDBC API Contains

java.sql package and javax.sql
    |                    |
    |                    |
Basic classes       Advanced Classes and interfaces
and interfaces

Who provide drivers Software --> database Vendor
Driver Software. We have to ask oracle to provide the driver Software. so they will provide jars.
        
        
Oracle Driver Software has classes that inplements interfaces of JDBC API which can be used for communication with Oracle Database


Multiple classes are there in Driver Software that implements interface of JDBC API. There is a Special Class called Driver class.

Every Driver Software is identified by driver Class

For Type 1 Driver Software define by SUN:

Driver Class name of type 1 driver Softeware: sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver

For Type 4: oracle thin

Driver class : oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver




===================================================================================

In JDBC API there is an INterface called Driver INterface


Driver Interface is present in java.sql package

If You want to develop your driver class , then you must Implement Driver Interface.
Driver Interface acts as requirement specification to develop Driver Class

who will provide Driver Software:

1. Type 1 --> (provided by JAVA only but till 1.7 version )
2. Thin -->(provided by Database Vendor)
3. 3rd paryy like Inet



Driver Softwares developed only in JAVA --> Pure JAVA Drivers
Driver Software developed in JAVA + othere language --> Partial JAVA Drivers
