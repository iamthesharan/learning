after completing the exectuion we need to close the resources.

    1. close result set  --> rs.cloase()
    2. close statement   --> st.close();
    3. close conncetion. --> con.close();
    
Per statement single result set is possible
Per Connection Multiple Statement is possible


Whenever we are closing statement object, we are not required to close resultset
Whenever we are closing Connection object, we are not required to close statement


closing Connection:

try{
    open declared Connection
    Perform Action
}
catch(SQLException e){

}
finally{
    Finally will execute for sure even if there is any exception
    con.close();
}

This was till 1.6v

After 1.7v Finally Block becomes zero due to the concept of try with resources

try with resources will close every resource after the competion of try.

syntax:

try (R){
    Content
}


Ex 

try(Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("JdbcUrl", "Username","password")){
    
}
catch(SQLException e){

}
