Categories:
1. Hardware Based/System Based VMs
2. Application Based/Process Based VMs

1. Hardware Based/System Based VMs:

    It provides several logical systems on the same computer with the Strong Isolation from Each Other. i.e on one Physical machines multiple Logical Machines.
    The Main Advantage of hardware based VMs is Hardware Resources Sharing and Improves Utilization of hardware Resources.
    Ex - Cloud VMs


2. Application Based/Process Based VMs:

    These VMs acts as Runtime Engines to Run a particular programing Language Applications.
    Ex -    JVM(Runtime Engine for JAVA Based Applications)
            CLR(Runtime Engine for .Net Based Applications)
