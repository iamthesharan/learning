Servlets are Java classes that conform to the Java Servlet API, which allows a Java class to respond to requests. Although servlets can respond to any type of request, they are most commonly written to respond to web-based requests. A servlet must be deployed to a Java servlet container in order to become usable.Although many developers use servlet frameworks such as Java Server Pages (JSP) and Java Server Faces (JSF), both of those technologies compile pages into Java servlets behind the scenes via the servlet container. That said, a fundamental knowledge of Java servlet technology could be very useful for any Java web developer.

What are JSPs and Servlets?
1. JAVA Code that runs on Web Browser.
2. Reads User action normally from user
3. Performs works
4. Returns the HTML Pages that is generated dynamically

Servlets and JSPs are build in web Servers  



Servlet Container:

Servlets are like Server Side JAVA Classes --> these Classes are capable to read the data which is comming from Browser.

Container: To execute this Server side java Classes you need a Servlet container

                                        Servlet Container
                                        

Browser Send the data to Servlet Container in the form of Http request. 
Servelet Container will first make this http data in the java bean objects.
So the Server Basically converts the data into HttpServletsRequest object.
And after that the container will forward this HttpServletsRequest object to Servlets Classes.
The Response we get is stored in the form of HttpServletsResponse Object.
and again this HttpServletResponse is converted back into http Response 



Which servlet Class the request object should go?

    Lets Say we have 4 Servlets Classes
    
    a.class, b.class, c.class, d.class --> binded in myapp application 

    Well it Depends on the URL, which class the object should go.
    
    we need to hit the Server URL. ex localhost:8080/myapp
    myapp --> its a servlet Application
    
    So if we need hello.html to load. This page must be saved in my application 
    
    So we need to hit localhost:8080/myapp/helo.html
    
    
    Now for Response: we can use the page adrress of servlets as /a, /b, /c, /d
    for the respective a,b,c,d servlet class.
    
    So put the response URL in form Action
    
    
    So when you submit the form request the url will become
    localhost:8080/myapp/a?name=Shashank
    So once the request is send to the Servlet Container, it will Create a request object and send it to the Servlet Class   
    
We have open Source Container from apache: Tomcat
