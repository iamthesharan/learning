Let us suppose MyThread class extends Thread Class. and This Thread Class implements Runnable Interface.


By Extending Thread Class

         Runnable
            |
         Thread
            |
         MyThread

By Implementing Runnable Interface: 2nd Approach

                Runnable
                    |
                MyRunnable

Runnable Interface Present in java.lang package and it contains only 1 method:

    public void run();


How To define the Thread using Runnable Interface.

Defining a Thread:

class MyRunnable implements Runnable{

    // This is the job of the Child Thread
	public void run() {
		for(int i=0;i<10;i++) {
			System.out.println("Child Thread");
		}
	}
}

public class test{
	public static void main(String ...args) {
		MyRunnable r=new MyRunnable();
		Thread t=new Thread(r); // This is main thread.
		t.start();
		for(int i=0;i<10;i++) {
			System.out.println("Main Thread");
		}
	}
}



It is always recommended to use Implementing Runnable interface instead of Extending Thread Class. Because it will allow the 
Flexibility to extend Some other class. But in case for Extending Thread Class you cannot extend some other class
