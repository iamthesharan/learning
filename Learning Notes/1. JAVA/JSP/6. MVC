MVC




                Controller
            /       |       
           /        |      ___________
          /         |      |Model    |
         /          |      |Object   |   
        /           |      |_________|
client              |
        \           |
         \          |
          \         |
           \        |
            \     View  (Just a Layout)

As a client we are only concern about view
Controler will send the data in the form of model object


In java 
Controller: is the Servlet.
View      : is the JSP
Model     : POJO format --> Plain old java Object


Never write Bussiness Logic on JSP Page.
Never write Operation code like Fetching data from DB in controller. rather just create a service class and Let Controller to fetch data from there. Service class will fetch data form DB. 
Controller is just to route the data to view.
        

Student.java: Simple POJO Class with constructor and getters and setters
StudentDataUtil.java: Model Class. Basically it is used for creating an object of POJO class and perform Operation on it.
    public static List<Student>getStudent(){
		List<Student> students=new ArrayList<Student>();
		students.add(new Student("Shashank","Sharan","sharans@amdocs.com"));
		students.add(new Student("Khushboo","Shivhare","kushi001@amdocs.com"));
		return students;
	}
    
MvcDemoServlet Class: Required to send the data to JSP 

protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
		List<Student> students=StudentDataUtil.getStudent();
		request.setAttribute("StudentList", students);
		RequestDispatcher dispatcher =request.getRequestDispatcher("/viewStudents.jsp");
		dispatcher.forward(request, response);
	}
