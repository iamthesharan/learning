6. What are wait(), notify() method.

    wait method is called by thread on the object if the thread need some updation on the object.
    notify method is called by Thread on the object if the thread is going to update something to the object.
    
    When a Thread Calls wait() method on an object, it must be the owner of the object. 
    i.e. it must have lock of the object before calling wait.
    Once wait is called by the thread on the object, it automatically realeases the lock as the object will be used by the notifying thread.

    So When Notify is called, The object must be the owner of the notifying thread.
    Once notifying completes, the thread may or may not immediately release the lock on the notified object.
