In the Main Class, you need to put annotation:
1. @EnableBatchProcessing - To Enable Batch Processing
2. @ComponentScan("//Packege for which the beans needs to be created") - Basically Here the Job Configuration Beans will be created


So Create a package called Config:
Inside this package Put the Job Configs and add the Annotaion @Configuration over the Class

@Configuration
class SampleJob{

}

To have the Job , Spring batch provides interface that is Job.
To Create a job you need to inject JobBuilderFactory Class into Configuration

To Start job:

      jobBuilderFactory.get("First Job").start()

To Have Step:
    To Create Step Spring Batch Provides StepBuilderFactory that we need to Inject in Config Class
