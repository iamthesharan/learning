Job - :

Transcation -> Here we are doing batch processing of Transactions. It can be 1000s of Transaction, It won't matter
So here Transaction is one Job


So here Transaction Involves 3 Steps:
1. Communicate with Bank
2. Debit Money
3. Send SMS/Email


So These are steps and it will be executed in Sequence


Step Types Provided By Spring Batch:
1. Tasklet Step
2. Chunk-Oriented Step

1. Tasklet Step: These are Simple Task and not a Complex Processing
    Transaction - Communicate with Bank
                - Debit Money
                - Send SMS/Email

2. Chunk Oriented Step : Dividing the Steps into chunks
    Example Reading huge Records from CSV and Processing it and Storing it to DB

        CSV -----> Spring Batch ------> DB

    So if you process this huge data in one Shot, it will give out of memory Exception
    So in Chunk oriented Steps you need to define Chunk Size i.e how many records at a time you want to process
    Suppose your chunk size is 3, and your CSV file records are 10000
    So once 3 Records are written in DB then next 3 Records will be written and this will continue till all the records are processed and written:


    So for Reading the Data from source Spring batch needs: Item Reader
    For Writing the Data in Target Spring Batch Needs: Item Writer
    To Process the Data Spring batch needs:  Item Processor.


    So Chunk Oriented Steps :   - Item Reader
                                - Item Processor
                                - Item Writer
