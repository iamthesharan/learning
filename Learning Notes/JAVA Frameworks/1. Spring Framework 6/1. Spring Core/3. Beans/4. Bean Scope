Bean Scopes:
1. Singleton - Default Scope
2. Prototype
3. Request
4. Session
5. Application

Bean Scope is a concept which defines how the bean has to be created and maintained by IOC Container.


Singleton Scope

Wherever we use the bean (Injection, Creation) with singleton scope, the same instance of the object will be returned.


@Scope(BeanDefinition.SCOPE_SINGLETON)

Since the same instance of Singleton bean will be used by multiple threads inside your application,
It is very important that these beans are immutable.
meaning later the Singleton object should not be modified in application anywhere.

This scope is more suitable for beans which handles service Layer, Repository Layer business logics as it has only methods and not data.


Building mutable singleton beans will result in race condition.
