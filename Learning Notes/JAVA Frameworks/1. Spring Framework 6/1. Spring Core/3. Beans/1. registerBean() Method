Sometimes we want to create beans based uppon certain Conditions:
Like If Condition Met we want to create bean for the Specific class and if not we want to create a bean of another class.

So for this purpose we can use registerBean() method.

context.registerBean("hondaCity", Vehicle.class, hondaCitySupplier);

context - The ApplicationContext instance object
hondaCity -  The name we want to give to the bean that we add to the Spring Context.
Vehicle.class - Bean Type.
hondaCitySupplier - Supplier function returning the object instance that we want to add to the Spring Context.


Ex :

if(SomeCondition) {
    context.registerBean("beanName", SomeBeanClass.class, Supplier);
}
else{
    context.registerBean("beanName1", SomeBeanClass1.class, Supplier1);
}

Note** @Component has more priority than registerBean.
So you need to remove the @Component if you're creating with registerBean();
