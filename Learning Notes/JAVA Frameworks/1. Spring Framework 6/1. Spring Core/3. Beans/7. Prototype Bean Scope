With Prototype Beans everytime we request a reference of a bean, Spring will create new object instance and provide the same. 

Prototype Scope is rarely used inside the application and we can use this scope only in the scenarios where your bean will frequently change the state of the data which will result in race condition inside multithreaded environment. Using Prototype Scope will not create Race Condition

@Scope(BeanDefinition.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)

Note if you Parent Bean is Singleton and You're injecting PRototype bean inside that bean, then the injected bean will be Singleton.


But if you Parent Bean is Prototype and You're injecting PRototype bean inside that bean, then the injected bean will be Prototype.

Mutable Objects which can be changed later are ideal for prototype Scope.
