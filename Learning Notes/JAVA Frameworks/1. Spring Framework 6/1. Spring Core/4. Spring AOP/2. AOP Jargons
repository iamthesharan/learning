Whenever we define an AOP or doing Configuration we need to follow WWW

WHAT  -> Aspect     (contains all NON BUSINESS Logics)
WHEN  -> Advice     (when the Spring needs to execute the given aspect. before or after the method call?)
WHICH -> Pointcut   (which method the framework needs to intercept and execute the given aspect).

JOINT POINT -> Defines what is the Triggering event that will execute your aspects. IN java the Jointpoint is always method call.


Developer want SOME LOGIC to be executed BEFORE each EXECUTION of method PLAYMUSIC() present inside the bean VEHICLESERVICE

SOME LOGIC      - Aspect
BEFORE          - Advice
EXECUTION       - execution
PLAYMUSIC()     - Pointcut
VEHICLESERVICE  - Target Object
