It's like Elastic Audio. Allows to apply time compression and Expansion on audio wave forms.
For getting the Flex button on each track, you should click on the flex button in the function bar.
and with division snap mode you can strech and compress.

Polyponic mode -> Instruments play multiple notes at time like Guitar, Paino
Monophonic -> Intruments that play one note at a time like bass


In Inspector Section there is a check named the complex. 
Make sure that is check when using with polyphonic mode because it will use more system resources to get the good quality sound.


While Grouping the Drums, Make Sure that in Editing, Phase-locked Audio is checked.
So while Editing it won't let other tracks to go out of phase.
For Drums you Should Select Rhythmic pattern


--------------

Slicing Algorithm:

Best use case is when you want some partaricular instrument sound from overall sound.
Example when you need kick from drums.
using Slicing Algorithm, You can right click on the Clip top and select slice at transient marker.

---------------

Speed and tempophone mode:
allows speacial effect by channging the speed and tempo of the clip

Speed will create a high pitch effect while compressing and low pitch effect while Expanding.
Tempophone will add some digital additions onto the stretched part based on chopped Small Granuel samples instead of increase the speed as in case of Speed Mode.


In File Editor, you can increase or decrease the transient Sensitivity by clicking on -/+



----------------

Flex Pitch-

You can Scale it in Any Scale.
Each Note has 6 dots.

Lower Middle Dot -> vibrato
Lower right Dot -> Formant Shift
Lower Left Dot -> Gain
Upper Left Dot --> Pitch Drift   --> Start of the note
Upper middle Dot -> Fine Pitch
Upper Right Dot -> Pitch Drift.  --> End of the note.


Convert Audio to MIDI:
You will get an option of "Create MIDI track from Flex Pitch Data" in Edit section in Track Editor.
