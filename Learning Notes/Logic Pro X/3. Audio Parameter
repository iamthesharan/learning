Sample rate - No of samples taken per second from analog to digital conversion process. 
Sample Rate is directly Proportional to File Size.
44.1Khz This means that 44100 samples of Sound are collected in 1 sec.

As per Nyquist Theorm,-
Your Sample Rate = 2 x (The highest Recording frequency you're recording). i.e 22.05KHz
Now This doesn't mean that human can hear upto 22KHz so we don't need more that 44.1Khz.
Sometimes Higher Sample rate has more good quality in mid frequencies which can't be capture in lower Sample rate.


Bit Depth: 
No Of bits(information) each Sample has.

Audio Buffer:
How the processor handle info.
