What SOA is?
It is a Collection of Architectural Principles to design and implement our Software Applicaitions in such a way that they are composed of Several services that have simple well defined interfaces and can use each other in a loosly coupled manner.

It is maintained by W3C or OASIS 

SOA has 2 Roles similar to web services.

Consumer <---------> Provider

Lets take an example of SOA Standard using Hospital Management System to define a service.

A Service According to SOA is an implementation of business logic that operates independent of state of other service.


AppointmentManagementService ----------> DoctorService
                  \                    /
                   \                  /
                    \                /
                     \              /
                      \            /
                       \          /
                        \        /
                         -------/------------------      
                               /                   |
                              /                    |
                             /                     |
                            /                      |
                           /                       |
                          /                        |
                    Clinical Service   ------> PatientService -----> BedManagementService                               

Lets say Hospital Purchase a clinical Service from different company, They can use it as long as the contract between these two remains same.

This Contract in case of SOAP web Services is WSDL file
In case of REST it's WADL file

The data format that is used to Exchange messages between these service is XML because XML has data as well as metadata.
