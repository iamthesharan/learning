SOAP -> Simple Object Access Protocol
Its a Specification defined by W3C.


<soap:Envelope> --> This is the root Element
    <soap:header/>  --> This stores the metadata
    <soap:body>
            --> here is the request payload if its a request or response payload if it's a response.
        <creditcard></creditcard>
    </soap:body>
</soap:Envelope>

If there is a Error in the request you can use soap fault element which is the child element of the body in response body:

<soap:Body>
    <soap:Fault>
        <soap:code>soap:Server</soap:code>
        <soap:Reason>
            <soap:text>
                Card Expired.
            </soap:text>
        </soap:Reason>
    </soap:Fault>
</soap:Body>

Whenever we throw Exception using JAVA, it goes to <soap:fault>

Soap Header:


<soap:header>
    <wsse:Security>
        <wsse:UsernameToken>
            <wsse:Username/>
            <wsse:Password/>
        </wsse:UsernameToken>
    </wsse:Security>
</soap:header>
