First Principle of Agile menifesto is that Our Highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and Continious delivery of valueable software.

What is prioritizing high value Software?

80 - 20 rule -> also known as vifredo pareto.

He saw that in his garden 20% of the Pea Pots produced 80% of peas.
So he Applies this logic in real world.
20% of the Population owns 20% of the city's land.

Conclusion: 80% of the Effects comes from 20% of the causes.

Most of the Software Projects in 1990's we failing due to focusing and giving too much time to the software features
that were never be used or rarely used by the customer.

Reports from Standish Group Says that,
45% of the features of the Software product were never used.
19% are rearly used.
16% are sometimes used.
13% are often used
7 % are always used.

So only 20% of the features are only used and this satisfy Pareto rules.
So in an agile team, this 20% is the most valueable part of the Software.
So this would be the part of the very first Sprint and you should prioritize this 20%.

So there Development team will first move to the Highest Priority feature
and then goes down to the lowest priority.

For Prioritizing the task, Agile Team uses Taskboard.
Like in JIRA Software 
Columns: User Stories, To Do, Doing, Done --> These columns are called Work Queues.



As per Agile Menifesto, The working Software is the primary mesuare of the progress.
