Rise of a Knowledge Workers - Not to be Specialized in One Area.
Challenges with Software Manufacturing.
1. Adapting to Changes.
    Most of the Project Manager Says : Plan the Work then Work on the Plan (But in agile this is not the case).
    We should be able to adapt the changes at any stage.
    Ex. Development Env might get changed, Development language might get change so we must be ready to adapt the changes.

2. Having a Short Term Planning.
    making a Long term Planning will increase Uncertainty.
    If you make a Short term Planning, you can able to adapt the changes easily.


Its Really Improtant to have agile Mindset rather than just following the agile practices.
Hence you should Focus on Why. Think about not to master them but think about the reasoning behind.
