Multitasking -> Rather than focusing on one thing, focusing on other things.

This Somtime has hidden cost. Multitasking increase context Switching. 
Each time you switch on task you need little bit of time to come on track.

Instead of focusing on diffrent things at once, the entire agile team will focus on limited set of high valued task.
this team can then provide high value work. 
this is called Continious delivery with short iterations.

Shotter timescales=Sprints (Short iterations).

Reducing Multitasking is one of the common ideas behind the agile framework called Scrum..
All the team members of the Scrum team works together on sprint and deliver the sprint.
