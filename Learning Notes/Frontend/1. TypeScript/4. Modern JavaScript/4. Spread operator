Suppose we have 2 String Arrays

const hobbies=['Sports','Cooking'];
const activeHobbies=['Hiking'];

1. Now if we push this hobbies String array, then the TypeScript will throw an error.

    String array Cannot be assignable to the String parameter.

    activeHobbies.push(hobbies); // so this is WRONG

    If you want to push all the hobbies to aciveHobbies, then you should use ... Spread Operator.

    activeHobbies.push(...hobbies); 



Spread Operator not only works in array but it also works in Objects.

const person={
    name:"Shashank",
    age:24
}

Now If we want to copy the person object then the below lines will only copy the reference of the person and will not actually make the Copy of the person.

    const copiedPerson=person;

So in order to copy the Entire object then we need to write the below lines:

    const copiedPerson={...person}; // It will actually Copy the values to the New array
