Getting a node version: node --version

Locally installed Node packages will be installed within a sub-directory named node_modules, and globally installed Node packages will be installed in the system-wide node_modules directory. 


To get the npm Version:                     npm --version

tsc app.ts --> this will generate app.js file
node app.js --> this will run the app.js file in cmd
