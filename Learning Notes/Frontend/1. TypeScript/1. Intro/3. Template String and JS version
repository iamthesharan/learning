`Hi There` --> The Values written in backtick(`) gives us the ability to inject the value directly into the String.

For Example:
    var names=`Shashank`;
    console.log(`Hi There! ${names}`);

but in JS Code you will see that the above lines of code has been converted like this

    var names = "Shashank";
    console.log("Hi There! " + names);
