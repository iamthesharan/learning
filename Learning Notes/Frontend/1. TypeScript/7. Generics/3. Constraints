    function merge<T,U>(obj1:T, obj2:U){ 
        return Object.assign(obj1, obj2);
    }


    So the Below Code will not throw the error but the logic will become wrong. assign method is used to merge object and not just a number.


    const mergeObject=merge({name:'Shasank'},30); // This will Compile fine because U can be of any type.

    But we can apply the constraint by extending the T and U with object.
    
    function merge<T extends object,U extends object>(obj1:T, obj2:U){ 
        return Object.assign(obj1, obj2);
    }


    const mergeObject=merge({name:'Shasank'},30); // Now this will throw an error
