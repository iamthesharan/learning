Content Child is Same as the View Child. 


The Difference is the View child will only be used with the View Selector. 
    ex: 
    <app-server #myServer>
        <p #myServerParagraph> This is my Server</p> // this can't be used with view Child.
    </app-server>


where as in Content child above paragraph can be use and will only be accessible AfterContentInit()
