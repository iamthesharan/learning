Lets Say we just want to display the Specific text in html.
ngIf directives works like if statement. It is a Structural Directive which adds or removes the element.

serverCreationStatus=false;


<p *ngIf="serverCreationStatus">Server Created</p>
<p *ngIf="serverCreationStatus()">Server Created</p>

What if we want to add the Else Condition?
    for that we will create a local refrence of the paragraph by using  #marker

<p *ngIf="serverCreationStatus(); else noServer">Server Created</p>
<ng-template #noServer>
    <p>No Server Was Created</p>
</ng-template>
