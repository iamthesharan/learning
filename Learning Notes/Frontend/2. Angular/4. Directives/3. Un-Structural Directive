Un-Structural Directive don't add or remove elements instead they only change the element they were placed on

1. ngStyle

<p [ngStyle]>Hi There</p>

here the square brackets is not the part of the directive name, the directive name is ngStyle
the Square bracket indicates that we want to bind to some property on this directive

The ng Style Directive experct to get the JS object
<p [ngStyle]="{'background-color':'red'}">Hi There</p>

    or


<p [ngStyle]="{backgroundColor:getColor()}">Hi There</p>

=====================================================================================================

ngClass --> it is used to change the class of the element.

<p [ngClass]="{online:serverStatus==='online'}"></p>

in style property in @Component Decorator:

style:[`
    .online{
        color:white;
    }
`];



so ngClass directive takes the object wigth key values pair.
key is the CSS Class name
Value will be the Condition for true or false and accordingly the class will be added


Example: 

<p [ngStyle]="{backgroundColor:getColor()}"  [ngClass]="{online:getServerStatus()==='Online'}">{{'Server'}} with Id: {{serverId}} is {{getServerStatus()}} </p>


===================================================================

ngFor --> this is a built in Directive so we will use * in front of it.

<server-name *ngFor="let server of servers"></app-server>

    Also to get the index:

    <server-name *ngFor="let server of servers; let i=index"></app-server>
    here index is the reserved keyword
