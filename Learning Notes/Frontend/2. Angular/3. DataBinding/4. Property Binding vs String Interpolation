We can use interpolation like below:

    <p>{{allowNewServers}}</p>

But we can also make use of property Binding here:

    <p [innerText]="allowNewServers"></p>    // this will also output the Same Result


Now the Best practice is to use String Interpolation when you want to change the HTML in the template.
and Use property Binding when you want to modify the element property.

Don't mix Property Binding with String Interpolation.
String Interpolation:   always done inside {{}}  --> {{allowNewServers}}
Property Binding:       always done in ""   -> [disabled]="allowNewServers"
