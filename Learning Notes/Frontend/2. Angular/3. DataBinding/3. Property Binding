Every HTML element has property.
let us assume a property disabled for button.

when we use this property and enclose these properties in square Brackets [], and then assing a value that changes the behaviour of the property, then this is called Property Binding.

Component.ts:

      allowNewServers=false;

template:
    <button [disabled]="!allowNewServers">Click Me</button>

property Binding can be used in  double quotes ""
