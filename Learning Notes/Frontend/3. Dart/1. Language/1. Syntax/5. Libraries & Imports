import 'dart:html';  // For dart libraries,
import 'package:test/test.dart'; //The package: scheme specifies libraries provided by a package manager such as the pub tool.

Sprcifying Library Prefix:

import 'package:test/test.dart'
import 'package:test/test1.dart' as test;

Element element1 = Element(); // Use the Element from test.dart;
test1.Element element2 = test1.Element();


Lazy Loading of Library:

To reduce a web app’s initial startup time.
To perform A/B testing—trying out alternative implementations of an algorithm, for example.
To load rarely used functionality, such as optional screens and dialogs.

import 'package:greetings/hello.dart' deferred as hello;

Future<void> greet() async {
  await hello.loadLibrary();
  hello.printGreeting();
}


In the preceding code, the await keyword pauses execution until the library is loaded
You can invoke loadLibrary() multiple times on a library without problem
