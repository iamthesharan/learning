find / -name bizip2  --> Searches bzip2 from absolute path
find . -name bzip2   --> Searches bzip2 in the current directory recursively

find / -name *demo* | sort  -> this will find demo from topmost directory and sort the result

find / -user grant  --> Shows all files that belongs to grant user
find / -group grant  --> Shows files belongs to grant group

sudo find / -size +50k  --> find size of the file >50k in system

stat  --> Stat is used for showing the statistic of the file.
stat test --> shows the stat of the file
stat -c "%s %n"  test  --> -c will format the output based on wildcards. %s for size and %n for name.


So with find you can use -exec to execute additional commands

find . -size +1M -exec stat -c "%s %n" {} \; --> {} this is the placeholder for exec

Sorting files based on smallest to largest
find . -size +1M -exec stat -c "%s %n" {} \; | sort -n  --> this will sort the output numerically
