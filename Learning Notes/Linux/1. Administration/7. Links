There are two types of links:

    1. Hard Links:
    2. Symbolic Links

1. Hard Links:

    A hard link is basically a file and it points to a spot on hard drive.

    Example file1 points to 1000 address (inode) in harddrive.
    If you create a hardlink file for file1 with name as file2, it will point to the exact same inode in harddrive.

    If you delete file1, then file2 will be there and is perfectly valid.


    ln SourceFile Hardlink

2. Symbolic Links:

    Symbolic Links points to the name of the file or descriptor instead of pointing to the spot on the harddrive.
    Suppose you have file1 and you created Symbolic link for file1 named as file2.
    Then file2 will point to the name of the file1.

    So If you delete file1, file2 will be completely useless because it refrences to the descriptor or name of the file1.

    ln -s SourceFile Softlink
