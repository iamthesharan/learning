Linux Kernels are the program that talks directly to the Hardware.
Its the Only program that talks to the Hardware directly.

Everything else has to talk to linux Kernel through System Calls.

Linux Ditribution:
When Linux Kernel is bundled with OS Software and Shipped Together, that is called Linux Distribution.
Example: Ubuntu, Android.


Distributions Family:
1. Red Hat Family
2. Debian Family
3. Source Code Distribution


Red Hat Family is the Oldest Family. 
But It has a problem. How Do you package and ship the Software?
Which version of Linux you are using? It doesn't explain Much.
So Red Hat Created Redhat package Management Software (rpm).
