DNF is a software package manager that installs, updates, 
and removes packages on Fedora and is the successor to YUM (Yellow-Dog Updater Modified)

[~]$ sudo dnf update

sudo allows execution using root user


==============

-> Installing Downloaded Packages:

sudo dnf install <Package Name>

-> Check in local software repo:  
    Note if you add the repo in the repo list then its easier to get the future updates

    sudo dnf repolist

    It is always better to download and install packages from repo instead of websites because
    packages in repo has hash stored which is check when installing software.
    DNF will refuse to install packages when the hash doesn't match making it difficult for hackers
    to exploite them


    One of the famous repo is epel-release.

        sudo dnf install -y epel-release

    The EPEL repository is a community supported repository hosted by the Fedora Community project.
    The EPEL repository is not a part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and does not fall under Red Hat's Production Support Scope of Coverage. 


    To Check where those files for epel-release are installed ?

    sudo rpm -qL epel-release

    -q = query Selector
    -L = List all licensed files.



    To list the repository packages for particular package:

    sudo dnf repository-packages epel list
