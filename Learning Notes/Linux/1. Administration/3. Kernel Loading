1. Kernel is just a program that loaded into the system memory
2. It's loaded by a program called Boot Loader that executed from ROM.
3. Kernel Loading can't be controlled by linux, it out of the OS scope.

Creating a Custom Demon:

A daemon is a type of program on Unix-like operating systems that runs unobtrusively in the background, 
rather than under the direct control of a user, waiting to be activated by the occurance of a specific event or condition. 
Daemons are usually instantiated as processes

Step 1: Create a file that needs to be run as daemon process. Its a good practive to keep the script name ending with d, like timed, messaged.
Step 2: Create a file in etc/init.d/ and here create a daemon Script.

#!/bin/sh
#chkconfig: 345 80 20
#
start(){
        nohup /root/Sharan/timed &
}
stop(){
        pkill timed
}

case "$1" in 
        start)
                start
        ;;
        stop)
                stop
        ;;
        *)
                echo $"Usage:$0{start|stop}"
                RETVAL=1
esac
exit 0


------------------------------------
chkconfig:

345 – runlevels that the service will be enabled for by default.
85 – start priority. The lower the number the higher the priority and the sooner a service will be started within a given runlevel.
15 – stop priority. The lower the number the higher the priority and the sooner a service will be stopped within a given runlevel.
