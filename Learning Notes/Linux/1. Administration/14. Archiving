In Linux we use Archiver to preserve meta data such as ownership, permissions, access control, list

The Tool we use to do this archive is Archiver.
in linux it is tar --> Tape Archiver.
It doesn't compresses the file but leaves the file to be compressed by other 

.tar file is also known as tarball which consist of all the files and folder togther as 1 file.


tar
--xattrs        ==>     Enable extended attributes support
-c              ==>     To Create an Archive
-v              ==>     verbose
-p              ==>     Save ownership and permissions
-f              ==>     Final name of the archive


tar --xattrs -cvpf demo.tar ./demo  --> to create a tarball
tar --gzip --xattrs -cpvf demo.tar.gz ./demo --> To create a zip file

tar:
-t : list the content of the file
-f : file name
-x : to extract

tar -tf demo.tar  --> Shows the files inside the tar
tar --gzip -tf demo.tar --> Shows the file inside the compressed archive


tar -xvpf demo.tar --> To Extract. Not keep f at the last.
To Extract Somewhere else:

tar -xvpf demo.tar -C /home/grant/downloads

zip demo.zip demo  --> This will let the file as it is and create a new zipfile.
But same is not the case with gzip or bzip2
