In Linux everthing is treated as a file whether it's directory, devices etc.

All files in Linux OS is devided into 3 types:

1. Normal Files/Ordinary Files  -> ex test.txt, test.java, binary files(images, audio etc) --> these files contains data.
2. Directory Files              -> represents directories --> contains files/subdirectories
3. Device Files                 -> here all device related files are there. 

our terminal also treated as a file which is device file.



In Linux, File Extension is not important. Linux is capable of recognizing the file.
to check the Extension.
file file1.jpg  -> gives you the Extension.


tty --> Print the file name of the terminal connected to standard input.
/dev/pts/0  --> here 0 represents the terminal number

To send the Output to different terminal

echo "Hello World" > /dev/pts/1


--------------------------------------------------

File System.
/etc  --> contains sensitive Config files.
/bin  --> constains System Utilities and binary executables like ls, cat and other commands
          To identy the Command location, type  "which less"
/sbin --> Commands that are intended to used by the super user like mount, mkfs
/dev  --> contains device files
/lib  --> shared libraries: its a symbolic link to /usr/lib like man pages, python, java
/usr  --> Contains various programs and libraries.
/var  --> Contains variable files, the file that can change a lot. like log files, mails
/home --> location where user home directory are placed.


whenever you want to create a hidden file in linux put a . in the first place of the name of the file.


Device Files:

Device files are used as a means  of communication between the system(the kernel) and the physical hardware device.
Device files receives request from the kernel and redirects it to the device driver which inturn send it to the physical device or vice versa.
