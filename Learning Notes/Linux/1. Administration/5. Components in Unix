There is a Hardware and to communicate with hardware we require a special Software called OS.

These Operating System Contains 2 Components:
1. Shell  --> User can only communicate with Shell. It is the outer layer of OS.
2. Kernel --> 

                |                |               |
    ------->    |   SHELL        |   KERNEL      | <-----    HARDWARE
                |                |               |
                |                |               |

Whenever you enter a command in terminal, Shell is going to read that command, check wether it's valid or not
and then convert it into kernel understandable and hand it over to the kernel.

Shell acts as interface between User and Kernel.

Kernel is the Core component of Unix OS.
