Data Streams:

1. Standard Input
2. Standard output
3. Standard Error


tee Command:
When you want to save the output to some file and also to pass the output to some other command, we use tee command.

ls -lrt | tee output.txt | wc -l

this will write the output of ls -lrt into output.txt and also send it to wc -l command.


ls | wc -c | tee output.txt  --> First process count and then write output.txt

ls -lrt | tee output.txt | wc -c |tee wc.txt --> 
this will print the ls -lrt output to output.txt and after that the output of ls -lrt will be transferd to command wc -c
and then the final output will be printed to wc.txt and on the terminal Screen also.


-------------------------
get the names of file from file and remove those files.

cat input.txt | rm   --> incorrect because rm command only accepts command line arguments and not stream argumnets.

So if we want to transfer the stream output to the rm command, then we need to convert the output to command Line argunment.
for that we will use xargs. 

cat input.txt | xargs rm
