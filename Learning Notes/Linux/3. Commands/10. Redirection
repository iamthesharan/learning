for redirection of output to file -> 

    cat 1>output.txt

    here 1 is the standart output terminal

For redirection of error to the output file -->

    here 2 is the error output

    cat 2>output.txt


For Reading input from file use:

    cat 0<output.txt


To do input, output and error redirection simulataneously

    cat 0<input.txt 1>output.txt 2>>error.txt
            OR

    cat <input.txt >output.txt 2>>error.txt

                OR
    cat input.txt > output.txt 2>>error.txt
                OR
    cat input.txt &>>output.txt


    & will send both error and output redirection together if the file is same
