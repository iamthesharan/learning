wc - print newline, word, and byte counts for each file

root@d87ed6b05871:~/Sharan# echo APPLE | wc
      1       1       6


-------

echo "HELLO" | wc -c --> this will give the length of the String inluding new line character. so it will give 6 as output.

If we dont want new line, the use 
echo -n "Hello" | wc -c

Inside the Shell Script if we want to assign the value to variable, we have to use command Substitution.

len=$(echo -n "Hello" | wc -c)



Options:

wc -c --> charactes.
wc -l --> lines
wc -w --> Word
wc -L --> No of charactes in longest lines.
