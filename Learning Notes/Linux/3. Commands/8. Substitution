Variable Substitution and Command Substitution.

Variable Substitution:
if x is the variable, the get the value of x by $x or ${x}


Command Subtitution:

`cmd`
$(cmd)

Write a Script to create log file with Time Stamp.

myDate=$(date '+%d_%m_%Y %H_%M_%S')
echo $myDate

            OR

myDate=`date '+%d_%m_%Y %H_%M_%S'`
echo $myDate

The above Code is partially Correct beacuse the below will then give an error.
    myDate="date '+%d_%m_%Y %H_%M_%S'"
    echo $($myDate)


To overcome this, we use:
    myDate="date '+%d_%m_%Y %H_%M_%S'"
    echo $(eval $myDate)

But this is also not a good Approach,
better to use function
function my_date {
  date "+%y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
}
echo $my_date



Or Else use \ 

myDate=`date +%d_%m_%Y\ %H:%M:%S`
echo $myDate
