It is the measure of how fast or responsive a system under:
1. A Given Workload
    -> Backend Data
    -> Request Volume

2. A Given Hardware
    -> Kind
    -> Capacity

Now We have to keep these 2 parameters fixed becase if they vary, The performance of the System may vary.
So while Measuring performance, we need to take these 2 parameters fixed.


System which has Huge amount of data will slightly to face more performance problem than the system with reduced amount of data.

If the Request Volume is high, the System will face more performance problem


If we increase the capacity of the hardware, performance problem generally go away
Now If we increase the Workload, the performance should degrade little instead of huge degradation

So the Overall Goal is that the System performance remains Stable as workload increases.
The System Performance should Resolve as we upgrade the hardwares.
