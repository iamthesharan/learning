Every Performance Problem is the result of some queue building up somewhere.
Ex: Network Socket Queue - So many Request conjestion
    DB IO queue - Lot of DB Request
    OS run Queue - How Much CPU is available, How much theads can be used.

Reasons for queue build-up:
1. Inefficient Slow Processing - If we have an Algorithm which is running Slow. Inefficient Code
2. Serial Resource Access - A particular code to be executed with only one thread serially.
3. Limited Resources Capacity - Let's say we've limited no of CPUs. Lots of vehicles to cross the roads and the road has only 1 lane

So the Role is to identify the queue buildup instead of upgrading the System.
