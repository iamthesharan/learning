1. Minimize Request Response Latency
    Latency is measured in time units
    Depends on  Wait/Idel time
                Processing time

2. Maximize Throughput
    Throughput is measured as Rate of Request processing
    Depends on:
    1. Latency - Inversely Proportional
    2. Capacity -  Directly Proportional
