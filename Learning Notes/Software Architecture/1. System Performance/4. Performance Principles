For High Performance:
1. High Degree of Efficiency
2. High Degree of Concurrency
3. High Degree of Capacity


Single Request Processing: Single Thread
Concurrent Request Processing: Multiple Thread.

Here We will discuss about Single Request Processing:
1. High Degree of Efficiency:
    Efficient Resource Utilization
        - IO - Memory/Network/Disk
        - CPU

        These Resources must be utilized Efficiently
    
    Efficient Logic:
        - Algorithms
        - DB Queries
    
    Efficient Data Storages:
        - Data Structures (Decide where to use MAP instead of list)
        - DB Schema (Indexing in DB)

    Caching :
        Caching Requires minimum code changes.

If we do this the the Response time will come down drastically for Single Request


For Multiple Request Simultaneously within a system.
2. High Degree of Concurrency:
    Hardware - Hardware should allow the request to deprocess simultaneously
    Software
        - Queueing
        - Coherence
