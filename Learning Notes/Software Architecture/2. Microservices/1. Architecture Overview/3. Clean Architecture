Lets Say there are 4 Layers from inwords to Outwards.

1st Layer - Entities
2nd Layer - UseCases
3rd Layer - Controllers, Presenters, Gateways
4th Layer - Web, UI, External Interfaces, DB, Devices

Separates the elements of the Design into Circle Levels


Purpose:
1. To Organise Codes with encapsulated Business Logic.
2. Keep the Core business Logic and the application domain at the center of the solution structure that is independent with presentation and data access layer.
3. Clean Architecture is divided into two main Elements:
    a. Policies: are business rules and procedures
    b. Details: are the Implementation Codes to carry out the Policies
4. Internal Layers should not have any dependencies of any third party libraries which allows to use different frameworks and tools and not to lock libraries if the technology is changed.
