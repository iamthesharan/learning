Events Created by the Services are stored in Event Store Database in the Form of Event List.
This event list is used to Store the Final State of Data into a Materialized View which is used for Reading.
Event List Can help to Replay the Event at that timestamp


With CQRS event Sourcing Pattern,
The Writing Database don't need to Store the Final State of data, insted it just stores the Sequences of the Events into the Write database.
The Data from the write Database Converted into Single Final State and Updated on the Read Database through events.
