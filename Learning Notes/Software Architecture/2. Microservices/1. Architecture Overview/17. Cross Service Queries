Problems with Cross Service Queries:
- If the Query is Complex, Retriving Data from Aggerator Service may Show Latency.
- Increases Coupling Risk

Solution:
1. Material View Pattern
2. CQRS - Command Query Responsibility  Segregation Pattern


1. Material View Pattern:

This Says about Duplication of the Data on Another Microservice.
Lets Say Microservice-A Stores the Data into Table A.
Microservice-B is dependent on data on Table A of Microservice.

So Meterialized View Pattern Says that, Create a View with the Required number of Columns in Microservice B database.
This View Will be Syned on any update on Actual Table A with an Event Generated by Microservice-A.

Although there can be Some Latency Due to queue mechanism in an event. And this Can lead to Data InConsistency in Some Case.




2. CQRS Pattern:
Here we have 2 Databases(Read and Write on the Same Service). The Sync is done from Write to Read Database via Events
