2. CircuitBreaker Pattern : If the Service is not Responding, it will break the Circuit and calls for the Failure Transaction.
3. Bulkhead Pattern : Patitioning the System into isolated components  to prevent failure of one component from affecting others.
4. TimeoutPattern :  Should not wait for Service Response for indefinite amount of time, throw an exception instead waiting too long.
5. Fallback Pattern: Providing Alternative behaviour in case of Failure or timeout
