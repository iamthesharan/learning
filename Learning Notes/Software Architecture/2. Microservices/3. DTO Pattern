DTO vs Model:


DTO (Data Transfer Object):
- DTOs are typically used to transfer data between software application subsystems or layers.
- They are often used in situations where you need to transfer data between different parts of your application or between your application and external systems (e.g., when making API calls).
- DTOs are designed to carry data and are usually simple POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) that contain fields and getters/setters.
- DTOs may contain only the necessary fields required for data transfer, and they may not have any business logic or behavior associated with them.
- DTOs are often used to encapsulate the data exchanged between the client and the server in a web application.


Model Class:
- Model classes, on the other hand, are typically part of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and represent the data in your application's domain model.
- They are often used to represent the structure and behavior of the data within your application.
- Model classes may contain business logic, validation rules, and behavior related to the data they represent.
- In web applications, model classes are often used to represent entities from the database or objects that are manipulated within the application's business logic.
- Model classes may also contain annotations or configurations specific to the persistence layer (e.g., JPA annotations for database mapping in Java).
