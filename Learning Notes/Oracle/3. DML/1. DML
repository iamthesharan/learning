DML Commands always interact with buffer
Hence it is slower


DML -->  Buffer --> DATABASE (on COMMIT)
            |
            |
        Removed from Buffer (on ROLLBACK)
        
        
        
DML -----> READ
    ------> WRITE  --> Row level Locked is made while performing DML.
    

If 10 rows are updated then 10 rows are locked by the user automatically.


Read --> SELECT
Write:  ----> INSERT
              UPDATE
              DELETE
              MERGE
