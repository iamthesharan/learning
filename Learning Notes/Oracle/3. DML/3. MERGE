Merge command in 9i was introduced to support INSERT AND UPDATE TOGETHER THROUGH A SINGLE STATEMENT

In 10g Orcale has introduced delete command also.


oracle 9i: insert+update together works with merge
Oracle 10g: INSERT+UPDATE+DELETE

POSSIBILITIES:

INSERT+UPDATE+DELETE    -->P
INSERT+UPDATE           -->P
UPDATE+DELETE           -->P
INSERT                  -->P
UPDATE                  -->P
---------------------------------
DELETE                  -->NP   |
INSERT+DELETE           -->NP   |
---------------------------------


SYNTAX:

    MERGE INTO <TARGET TABLE> A
    USING <SOURCE TABLE> B
    ON (A.COL1=B.COL1)
    WHEN MATCHED THEN
        UPDATE SET A.COL2=B.COL2 , A.COL3=B.COL3
    WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
        INSERT (A.COL2, A.COL3) VALUES (B.COL2, B.COL3)
        
    
    
TARGET TABLE WILL ALWAYS BE 1.
SOURCE TABLE CAN BE MULTIPLE ie. we can either provide table or can also use SELECT Statement.
ON clause will have Condition  --> But these conditional columns cannot be in the UPDATE Statement.




    MERGE INTO <TARGET TABLE> A
    USING (SELECT * FROM <SOURCE TABLE>) B  --INLINE VIEW
    ON (A.COL1=B.COL1)
    WHEN MATCHED THEN
        UPDATE SET A.COL2=B.COL2 , A.COL3=B.COL3  
        DELETE WHERE A.COL2=B.COL2
        /* THESE TYPES OF UPDATE + DELETE IS WRITTEN WHEN YOU WANT TO UPDATE THE TRIGGER TABLE OR SOME LOG TABLE AND THE DELETING THE RECORD*/
    WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
        INSERT (A.COL2, A.COL3) VALUES (B.COL2, B.COL3)
