SHOW USER; --> Shows the User with which we are connected.

NOW 

GRANT SELECT ON EMP TO "USER2"; --> This means USER2 can select data from EMP table of USER1 Schema. but USER2 has to provide Schema name

SELECT * FROM USER1.EMP;



GRANT ALL ON EMP TO U2;  --> Granting all the privilages on EMP object of U1 to U2

GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON EMP TO U1, U2;  --WE CAN grant MULTIPLE PRIVILAGES on object TO ONE Schema
                                        --We can grant PRIVILAGES ON OBJECT TO MULTIPLE Schema
                                        --We can grant privilages to Schemas for only one object in a single statement
                                        
U1> GRANT SELECT ON EMP TO U2 WITH GRANT OPTION; -->If U1 has give U2 the privilage to Grant privilage, then only U2 can grant privilage to other users
U2> GRANT SELECT ON EMP TO U3 ;

now  select * from U2.emp; --> invalid. the attached Schema must be of the owner.
     select * from U1.emp; --> valid
