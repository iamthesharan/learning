DDL --> Data Defination Language  --> DEALS WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THE DATABASE

DDL always interact with the database directly. hence there is an implicit commit

There will be two commit for the DDL command

commt; //madatory before any ddl
DDL COMMAND;
commit; // based on the success of the previous command

Every DDl command is a three Step Process

DDL commands are faster.
Ex truncate is faster than delete


DDL Commands:

CREATE
ALTER
TRUNCATE  --> After Truncating, the Structure of the table will remained and the entire data will be removed
RENAME    --> to change the name of the object
DROP      --> remove the structure and data
FLASHBACK --> When object is droped, it is removed and goes to the recycle bin. butwith FLASHBACK, it can be bought back if it is in the recycle bin
PURGE     --> Object will be removed from the recycle bin
