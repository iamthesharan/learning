1. Creating a fresh table:

        CREATE TABLE STUDENT( 
                ROLL_NO NUMBER(3), 
                'NAME' VARCHAR(20), 
                DOB  DATE 
        );


2. Creating a new table with existing table with all data

        CREATE TABLE TBAP_ITEM_TEMP AS
        SELECT * FROM TBAP_ITEM;
        
3. Creating a new table with existing data and a selected columns
        
        CREATE TABLE TBAP_ITEM_TEMP AS
        SELECT CUSTOMER_ID, SUBSCRIBER_ID FROM TBAP_ITEM;
        
        
4. Creating a new Table without data but with same structure:
    
    For this we need to provide any false condition
         
        CREATE TABLE TBAP_ITEM_TEMP AS
        SELECT CUSTOMER_ID, SUBSCRIBER_ID FROM TBAP_ITEM 
        WHERE 1=2;
