

We can rename table, column, contraints.


1. Changing the name of the table:

        RENAME <OLD> TO <NEW>;
        
        RENAME EMP TO EMPLOYEE;

2. Changing the name of the column:
        
        ALTER TABLE <TABLE_NAME>
        RENAME COLUMN <OLD> TO <NEW>;
        
        ALTER TABLE TBAP_ITEM_TMP
        RENAME COLUMN MAIN_IND TO MAIN_INDICATOR;
        
        
2. Changing the name of the Constraint:
        
        ALTER TABLE <TABLE_NAME>
        RENAME CONSTRAINT <OLD> TO <NEW>;
        
        ALTER TABLE TBAP_ITEM_TMP
        RENAME CONSTRAINT TBAP_ITEM_PK TO TBAP_ITEM_CONSTRAINT_PK;
