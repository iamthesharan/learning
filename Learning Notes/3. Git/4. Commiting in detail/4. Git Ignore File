We can tell git which files and directory to ignore in a given repository using a .gitignore file
This is useful for files you know you never want to commit including:

Secret, API Keys, Credentials etc.
Operating System files.
Log Files.
Dependencies and Packages

.gitignore
 
Create a file called .gitignore in the root of the repository. Inside the file, we can write patterns to tell git which files and folders to ignore.

.DS_Store will ignore files named .DS_Store
folderName/ will ignore an entire directory
*.log will ignore any files with the .log extension

Now if you type git status, git will not track the changes in the files name present in .gitignore
