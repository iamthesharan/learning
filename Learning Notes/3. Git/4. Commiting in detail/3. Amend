Suppose you made a commit and realized you forgot to include a file or may be you made a typo in the commit message that you want to correct.
Rather than making a brand new separate commit, you can redo the previous commit using the --amend option


git commit -m "Some Commit"  
---> After doing commit you've found that you missed one file to include in commit. So now you will again add that file in staging.

git add missed.txt
git commit --amend  --> This will redo the previous commit
