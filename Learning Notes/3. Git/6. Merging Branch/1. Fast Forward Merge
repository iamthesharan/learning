You have one Branch Created from Master Branch.
Now You wanna merge that branch and for that you have to go to master branch.

git switch master
git merge <branch1>


basically here we are merging the commits in fast forward merge.

=================

merging Conflicts :
It's good to create a new Branch and then merge on it rather than directly merging on master branch.
