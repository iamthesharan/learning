Spring Core is at the heart of the Entire Spring Ecosystem.


Inversion of Control:
Any Application you will build on Spring framework, that will follow IOC priciple.
It is a Software Design Principle
It Says never ever create an object in your program directly, instead describe the ways objects has to be created to an external Entity (like configs).

Means as a developer I should never take the responsibility of creating my own Dependency or the object that my program needed instead I should rely on framework or an external entity for the configration and the objects that our program needed.

This is called Outsourcing the creation of objects.
