A Race Condition occurs when two thread Access the shared Variable at the same time in Singleton Scope

//Thread 1
if (!reservedTable.contains("Table1")){
    reservedTable.put("Table1","User1");
}

//Thread2
if (!reservedTable.contains("Table1")){
    reservedTable.put("Table1","User2");
}

Here if reservedTable is a Singleton object and both the threads able to Execute the if Statement Conditon,
then both thread will Execute put method on reservedTable object for "Table1" key entry.
