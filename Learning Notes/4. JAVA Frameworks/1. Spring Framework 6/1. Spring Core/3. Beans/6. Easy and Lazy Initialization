By Default Spring will Create all the Singleton Beans eagerly during the Startup of the application itself. This is called Eager initialization

We can change the Default Behaviour to initialize the Singleton beans lazily only when the application is trying to refer the bean. This approach is called Lazy Initialization.


Example:

@Component
@Lazy
class Person {

}

Espcially when there remote scenario for which the bean is used rarely. Like Deleting an account, the we can go for lazy initialization as there is no need to create a bean by Spring IOC Container during the initialization of the application.

Note in case of Lazy initialization, If the Exception happens while the Bean creation, it will throw runtime Exception


Eager Instantiaion -  Recommended.
