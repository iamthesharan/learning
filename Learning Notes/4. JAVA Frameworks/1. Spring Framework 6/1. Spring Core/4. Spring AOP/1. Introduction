Aspect Oriented Programming:
1. AOP module is present in Spring core Framework
2. With the help of AOP and Aspects, we can build applications by separating the cross cutting concerns like transaction management, logging, security, auditing into a separate place to build a better maintainibility inside our application

AOP dynamically injects the logic inside aspect whenever a particular method is executed inside application. It is like a pluggable code.



With AOP, All the Non Business logic will be moved into different Location which will make your application clear, clean and maintainable
