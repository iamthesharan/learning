We've seen that with Stereotype Annotations, we dont have control while creating a bean. But what if we want to execute some instructions post spring creates the bean.

For this we can use @PostConstruct.
This means once the constuction of the bean is done, it can execute the method which is anotated with @PostContruct


@Component
public class Vehicle {

    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @PostConstruct
    public void postConstructMethod() {
        this.name = "Honda City";
    }
}
