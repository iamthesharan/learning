Creating Beans with the help of @Component annotation

@Component
@Data
public class Vehicle {
    private String name;
}

Many Times we have thousands of classes inside our web applications and we may dont want to write methods with @Bean annotation as it will be very complex process.


So here comes @Component:

We need to put @Component on JAVA POJO class and with that we don't have to create any object for that in order to register it into context. It will automatically convert it to Bean.


@ComponentScan:
Since Spring Cannot Go and scan all of your classes and packages in your app.
To make IOC container performance better, @ComponentScan is used in Config class to scan all our @Component class.

@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.iamthesharan.springproject.beans")
