When Possible, a commit should encopass a single feature, change or fix. In other words, try to keep each commit focused on a single thing. This makes easier to undo or rollback changes later on.

Commit messages: Past or persent tense

Note while Commiting if your message is a paragraph, then simple execute git commit. It will open an editor and there you can write the paragraph and save it
