Suppose I've been assigned a task to resolve the bug and I need to delete some part of the code.
Another teammate is working on functionality that needs to be added in the project and is dependent on the above piece of code on which I'm working.
So If I made changes on the file, then that may impact the other developer.

To overcome this, we need branching
Branches are the alternate timeline of the project
They Enable us to create separate context where we can try new things or even work on multiple ideas in parallel.
If we make changes on 1 branch, then they will not impact the other branch(unless we merge the changes)
