Instantiate a different Product based on Some Conditions.
Here the SimpleFactory Class has a Static method which will accepts a parameter and based on this parameter we will instantiate a product.


In Client:

public class Client {
    public static void main(String ...args){
        Post post=PostFactory.createPost("product");
        System.out.println(post);
    }
}
