Whenever two or more classes are designed to work together, and they form a kit of some sort.
Whenever we have multiple sets or kit of objects that client needed, then we can use the abstract factory.

Factory vs Abstract Factory:


With the Factory pattern, you produce instances of implementations (Apple, Banana, Cherry, etc.) of a particular interface -- say, IFruit.

With the Abstract Factory pattern, you provide a way for anyone to provide their own factory. 
This allows your warehouse to be either an IFruitFactory or an IJuiceFactory, without requiring your warehouse to know anything about fruits or juices.
