Prototype pattern uses Clone methods in order to create objects of class.

User of the Builder pattern has to call the Constructor of the Product Class (inside build method) to create the object
In Prototype Design pattern whoever is going use the design pattern has to call the clone method which will create the object.
So the user of prototype design pattern doesn't work with the constructor of the product class.
 


 We will Create builder as a Separate Class. This makes our Builder Design pattern easy to work with legacy code.
 You can still use Builder pattern with the classes of the legacy Code which used to Create an object and your builder is also a separate class so it will not let your code to break.

 In Prototype we need to modify the existing code as we need to override the clone method.
 So using prototype is a bad idea for legacy code where the changes will need high cost.
