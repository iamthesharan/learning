Resource Plugin copies the resources to the class directory.

you can override the resources directory by:


<build>
        ...

        <resources>
            <resource>
                <directory>src/resource1</directory>  // Here you can change the path of resource folder
            </resource>
            <resource>
                <directory>src/resource2</directory>  // Here you can change the path of resource folder
                <includes>
                    <include>**/*.properties</include> // You can include only that specific file.
                </includes>
                <excludes>
                    <exclude>**/*.txt</exclude>  // You can exclude the file
                </excludes>
            </resource>
        </resources>

        ...
</build>

Once you run the resources:resources plugin, you will see the resouces in target/classes folder
