A lifecycle is a predefined group of build steps called phases.
Each phase can be bound to one or more plugin group
All the work done in maven is done by plugin
Lifecycle and Phases provide the framework to call plugin goals in sequence

Maven has three predefined lifecycles:
1. clean - cleans the project, removes all build artifacts from working directory.
         - Define with plugin bindings
        
2. default -  Does the build(Compilation) and deployment of the project.
           -  Defined without plugin binding, bindings are defined for each packaging
3. site -  Creates a website for the project
        -  Defined with plugin bindings
        -  Least used in enterprise


1. Clean Lifecycle: 
    \
     Phases Involved:   1. Pre - Clean  => No Plungin Bound
                        2. clean        => Maven Clean plugin Bound, Goal: Clean
                        3. Post - Clean => No Plungin Bound

        These phases will be invoked in sequence

2. Default Lifecycle:
    \
     Phases Involved:
     1. Validate - Verify the project. Makes sure we have project. Pom can be parsed with proper XML and Matched with XSD
     2. Compile - Compile with JAVA Compiler
     3. Test - Test Compiled Source
     4. Package - Package Compiled files to packaging types
     5. Verify - Run Integration Test
     6. Install - Install to local maven repo
     7. Deploy - deploy to shared maven repository


     All Default Lifecycles:
        1. Validate
        2. Initialize
        3. Generate Sources
        4. Process Sources
        5. Generate Resources
        6. Process Resources
        7. Compile
        8. Process Classes
        9. Generate Test Sources
        10. Process Test Sources
        11. Generate Test Resources
        12. Process test Resources
        13. Test Compile
        14. Process Test Classes
        15. Test
        16. Prepare Packages
        17. Package
        18. Pre-Integration Test
        19. Integration Test
        20. Post Integration Test
        21. Verify
        22. Install
        23. Deploy


        Default Life Cycle for JAR Packaging:
        1. Phase: Process Resources
           Plugin: maven-resource-plugin:resources
        
        2. Phase: compile
           Plugin: maven-compiler-plugin:compile
        
        3. Phase: process-test-resources
           Plugin: maven-resources-plugin:testResources

        4. Phase: test-compile
           Plugin: maven-compiler-plugin:testCompile

        5. Phase: test
           Plugin: maven-surefire-plugin:test

        6. Phase: package
           Plugin: maven-jar-plugin:jar
        
        7. Phase: install
           Plugin: maven-install-plugin:install
        
        8. Phase: deploy
           Plugin: maven-deploy-plugin:deploy

3. Site Build Lifecycle
   Phase: Pre-Site      Plugin: none
   Phase: site          Plugin: maven-site-plugin
   Phase: Post-site     Plugin: none
   Phase: Site-Deploy   Plugin: maven-site-plugin:deploy
