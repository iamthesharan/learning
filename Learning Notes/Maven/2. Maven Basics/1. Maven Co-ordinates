Maven Co-ordinates are used to Identify Maven Artifacts
Together they Identify location in maven repo.

groupId: Typically unique to organization
artifactId: Typically project name
version: Specific version of the project

Note: GroupId and version can be inherited from parent POM

Versions:

    Example : 2.1.1-987-beta
    1. Major Version - First Numner
    2. Minor Version - Second No.
    3. Incremental Version (Patch) - 3rd Number
    4. Build Number (CI Build) - Fourth Number
    5. Qualifier - 5th String

    Snapshot Versions:
    -SNAPSHOT Version - This tells maven that it's not a stable release. The project is still under development

    For Non Snapshot Version, Maven once download the dependency from Remote Repo to Local Repo
    it will never fetch again that dependency until and unless it is deleted from local repo.

    For Snapshot version - By Default maven will check remote repo once per day.
                           And this option is configurable.
