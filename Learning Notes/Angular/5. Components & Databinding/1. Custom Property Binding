if we want to access the property which is present outside the component, Custom Property Binding will be helpful.

Inside app.component.html:
    <app-server-element *ngFor="let element of serverElements" [element]="element"></app-server-element>      

serverElements is and array of objects which is defined in AppComponent.
Now I want to use the each element and Store it in ServerElementComponent in a variable element which is inside AppComponent.
So in this case we need to inject the element in ngFor into the ServerElementComponent.
How to do that?

inside Server Element component :
1. define a Variable with the same type as of element in ngFor.
2. add @Input() property Decorator in front of the element variable in ServerElementComponent.

ServerElementComponent:

  @Input() element:Element={};


====================================================================================================
Using Alias.

    suppose you want to use some diffrent name like srvElement while accessing from outside for injecting the value..

    <app-server-element *ngFor="let element of serverElements" [srvElement]="element"></app-server-element>      


    For that you need to pass sting argument as alias in @Input Decorator.

      @Input(srvElement) element:Element={}; / now this will be used as srvElement and not just element for outside access




So the Overall Conclusion:
we are sending the data from outside component into inside component
