AppComponent --> it is a root Component.
This will hold our entire application

Creating a Component:
Now all the Components will be added in the AppComponent part ie. app.Component.html
All the app related content will go into this app folder
Best practice is to create a folder with the component name and add the component into it.
    Example: server.component.ts
    Component is basically a class

Creating a Component Class:
1. Create a class (eg. ServerComponent) and export it So that we can use it in other files too.
2. Add the @Component Decorator on the class and for that we need to import the Component from @angular/core
3. Provide the Object as an argument to the @Component Decorator.
    a. This Object Should have attribute:
        i. selector: this is the HTML tag into which your template is gonna rendered. add prefix like add to the selector
        ii. templateUrl: this is the url of the html file which holds the template to be rendered.
        iii. template: we can also add template inline. You can use Backtick `` here to inject the values
        iv. styleUrls: [./server.component.css]
        v. styles:[`h3{color:blue}`]
4. Now we need to register the Component to the Module on which it required.
5. Here Module is a bundle of all the Functionalities and Components. So we need to register the ServerComponent to app.module.ts
6. By this we will tell Angular to scan the component while loading the application.
7. Registration of the component is done in the Declaration section of the module

Creating a Component with CLI:

    ng generate component servers
                or
    ng g c servers

You Can also use the Selector attribute in diffrent ways:

1. attribute selector: 
    selector: '[app-servers]'   -> <div app-servers></div>

2. Class Selector:

    selector:'.app-servers'    --> <div class="app-servers"></div>
