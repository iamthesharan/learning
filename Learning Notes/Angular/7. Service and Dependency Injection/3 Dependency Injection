When it comes to services, Do not instantiate on your own.
Angular Dependency Injector help us with that.

Dependncy Injector will inject the instnace to our Component class automatically.
We just need to inform angular that require Some instance.
How to do that?

1. constructor(private loggingService:LoggingService){
        // This will informs angular that we will need the instance of the logging services.
        //Think about the Components that we create, who is responsible for creating the instance of the class? -->
        // Answer is Angular.
}

Now from the above angular knows what we want. But it doesn't know how we want.

2. To let angular know how to give the instance, for that we need to provide the Service.
    fot that we will add one extra property in the @Component Decorator.
