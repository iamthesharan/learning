Directives are instructions in the DOM.
Example Component are directives but directives with the template.
We can make our own directives

<p appTurnGreen >Hi There</p>

appTurnGreen is a directive here
We can use directives with Attribute Selector.

@Directive({
    selector:'[appTurnGreen]'
})
export class TurnGreenDirective{
    
}
