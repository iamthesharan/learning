suppose in index.html you've wrote:

<script>
    var GLOBAL="I am Global"; // This is attached to window object. now to access this GLOBAL variable in TS file we have to use Declare.
</script>


.ts file:

declare var GLOBAL:any; // this says the TS to not to worry, GLOBAL will exist
console.log(GLOBAL);
