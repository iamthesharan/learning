Suppose you are getting data from Backend
and we get the object of the user we fetched.
constant fetchedUserData={
    id:'ul',
    name:'Max',
    job:{title:'CEO', description: 'My Own Company'}
}

Now Suppose if the Data fetched doesn't contain job, so here we can use optional Chaning.

constant fetchedUserData={
    id:'ul',
    name:'Max',
    // job:{title:'CEO', description: 'My Own Company'}
}

console.log(fetchedUserData?.job?.title);

if fetchedUserData exist then go to job. If job Exist then go to title.
