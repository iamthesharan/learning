const hobbies=['Sports','Cooking','Singing'];

const [hobby1, hobby2, hobby3]=hobbies; So here hobby1 = hobbies[0], hobby2=hobbies[2], hobby3=hobbies[3]

Below will assign the hobbies[0] to hobby1 and merge the remaining array to the remainingHobbies
const [hobby1, ...remainingHobbies]=hobbies;

Destructing Objects:

const {firstName, age}=person;

here firstName and age must be the attribute name of the person. while deconstructing arrays, it values gets assigned sequentially
but this is not the case with objects. you need to specify the correct attribute names.

You can also provide the arbitary name to the firstName attribute.

const {firstName:userName, age}=person; // here userName is the arbitary name for firstName.

{firstName:userName, age}  ---> This is basically we are deconstructing the person and storing it in a constant.
So now you can access the firstName with userName
