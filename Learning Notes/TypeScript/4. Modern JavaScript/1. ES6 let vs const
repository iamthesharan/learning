Const Keyword: Const keyword once assigned cannot be changed.

const userName="sharans";
//userName="shashank";  --> This will not work since the userName is defined as const


Let Keyword:

let Can be changed and is similar to var.
You should not use var

Let vs Const:

let is available in the block scope in which it is defined

where as var we only have a global and a function scope

for Example:

1. The Below code will work since it has result variable defined in function scope
    function add(n1:number,n2:number){
        var result=n1+n2;
        return result;
    }

2. The Below Code will also Work since it has result variable declared in global Scope.

    var result;
    function add(n1:number,n2:number){
        result=n1+n2;
        return result;
    }

3. Now if you use this in if Statement, it will  compile in typeScript and it will no throw error in JS file.

    if(age>20){
        var isOld=true;
    }

    console.log(isOld);  // this will print true in JS.

4. Now Change the isOld type to let.

    if(age>20){
        let isOld=true;
    }

    console.log(isOld);  // this will throw error in JS as let variable can be used inside the block scope
