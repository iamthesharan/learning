Remember JS will only have public access modifier where TS can have private as well as public modifier.

=========================================================================================


Syntax for Constructor:

    names:string;
    age:number;
    constructor(names:string,age:number){
        this.names=names;
        this.age=age;
    }

    =============

    Now this constructor can also be written by removing the instance variable. For that you just need to provide access modifier
    at the begening of the parameter in the constructor. TS will automatically Declare and initialize at the time of object creation

    constructor(private name:string, public age:number){
        
    }
