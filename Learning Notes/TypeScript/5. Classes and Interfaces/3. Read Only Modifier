Sometimes you need Some variable that should not only Private or public but should never change once initialized.
You can use read only in this case.


readonly will only valid in TS and Not JS

class Department{
    private readonly names:string;
    age:number;
    constructor(names:string,age:number){
        this.names=names;
        this.age=age;
    }
    describe(this:Department){
        console.log(names);
    }
}

or:

    constructor(private readonly id:number, public age:number){
        
    }
