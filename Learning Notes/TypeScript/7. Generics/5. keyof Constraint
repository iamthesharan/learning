Suppose we have a function that extract the parameter and display.

function extractAndDisplay(obj:object, key:string){
    console.log(obj[key]);// here we will get an error because TS don't know that the object that we are getting here will really have the key.
}

extractAndDisplay({},'name');// throw an error.


to overcome this problem we need to provide the generic type for object which extends the object type and key which extends the key of the object;



function extractAndDisplay<T extends object, U extends keyof T>(obj:T, key:U){
    console.log(obj[key]); // This is valid now
}
extractAndDisplay({name:"Shashank},'name');// This is valid now.
