Class vs Interface which is costly?

Class is costly.
When we should use class?

    class test{
        void m1(){}
    }

    test t=new test();
    t.m1();//


and Interface is the light weight Component.

In case of class we need to create an object but not in case of interface.

Now I have a static method. and this static method is no way related to object.
If the static method no way realted to object and if you have only static methods, then why to go for class? just go for interface. It will be less costlier

From 1.8 v onwards, static methods are also allowed in interface

Note Interface Static methods is not available to the implementation class.
hence Interface Static methods must be called by the interface name only.


inferface I{
    public static void m1(){
        System.out.println("Interface Static methods");
    }
}
class Test implements I{
    public static void main(String ...args){
        I.m1();// valid
        m1();// Invalid
        Test.m1(); // Invalid
        Test t=new test();
        t.m1();// Invalid
    }
}
