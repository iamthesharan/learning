1. Underlying datastructure is HashTable    |   1. Undelying Data Structure is Linked List + HashTable

    based on hashcode of keys
    
    
    
Linked HashSet and Linked HashMap are commonly used for developing Cache based Application.


In case of HashMap, JVM will compare with .equals methods for searching duplicate keys.

ex

HashMap m=new HashMap();
Integer I1=new Integer(1);
Integer I2=new Integer(1);
m.put(I1,"Shashank");
m.put(I2,"Sharan"); // Here I1.equals(I2) will be performed
sop(m);

O/P
[1=Sharan]


In Case of IdentityHashMap, JVM will compare with == operator for searching duplicate keys.
ex:

IdentityHashMap m=new IdentityHashMap();
Integer I1=new Integer(1);
Integer I2=new Integer(1);
m.put(I1,"Shashank");
m.put(I2,"Sharan"); // Here I1.equals(I2) will be performed
sop(m);
