If we represent large amount of data, we need Collection Classes.

Suppose if we want to Represent 10000  variables.

int a1, int a2, ......int a10000; //Bad Approach
Student s[]=new Student[10000]; //Okay but not good

Problems with Arrays:

    1. Arrays are Fixed in Size --> Upto 10000 we can easily represent, but we Cannot increase the size. Its Fixed.
    2. If only 2 inputs but the array created is on 10000 size. This is waste of memory.--> To use arrays we need to get the size in advance.
    3. Arrays can hold only Homgeneous datatypes:
        Person p[]=new Persons[10000];
        p[1]=new Person();
        p[2]=new Student(); // Incompatible Types 
        
        p can able to represent only Person datatype
        
        To Overcome point 3, use Object Array
        
        Object o[]=new Object[10000];
        o[1]=new Person();
        o[2]=new Student();
    
    4. Readymade method support is not abailable in arrays. For sorting, it's dependent on Programmers. In case of Collection Use treeset


Array: An Array is an indexed Collection of Fixed no of Homogeneous data elements



To Overcome Above Problems, we Must go for Collection Concepts.

1. Collections are Dynamic in Size.
2. Collections can hold both Homogeneous and Hetrogeneous Values.
3. Every Collection class is implemented with some standard Data Structures. Hence Every Collection class has readymade method Support.





                                            Arrays                  |               Collections
                                                                    |
    1. Performance wise Array is good.                              |    1. Performance wise Collection is Okay
    2. Memory Wise array is bad.                                    |    2. Memory wise Collection is good.
    3. Can hold Primitives and Objects                              |    3. Can only hold Objects.  
    
    
    
    
    
    
Collections:
If you want to represent a group of individual Objects as a single Entity. The We can go for Collection.


Collection framework:
Contains Several Class and interface which is used to represent the group of individual Object as a single Entity.
