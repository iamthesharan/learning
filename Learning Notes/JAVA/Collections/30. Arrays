By using list if we perform any Change, automatically, that change will be reflected in the array.


1. 

String[] S={"A","Z","B"};
List l=new Arrays.asList(S);
S[0]="k";
sop(l); //["k","Z","B"];


2. extending or redusing the size is not allowed by using array reference in list.

    l.add("k");
    l.remove("k");
    
    this will give RE: Unsupported Operation Exceptions.
    
    l.set(1,"k"); // valid
    l.set(1,new Integer(10)); //RE: ArrayStoreException. By using list with array reference, we are not allowed to replace with heterogeneous objects
