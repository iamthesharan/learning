Q1. Difference Between Arrays and Collections:
    a. Arrays are of Fixed Size. Once you define the Size of the Array, you can't extend the size of the original Array. But in case of Collections, Size is Dynamic.

    b. Arrays can be Sometimes waste of memory as if you need small amount of data and You're defining the Size greater than that, then there is a waste of memory. In case of collections, the size is dynamic and dependents of type of the Collection Objects.

    c. Arrays Holds Homogeneous data. Collections can store both Homogeneous and Hetrogeneous data.

    d. Readymade method support is not abailable in arrays. For sorting, it's dependent on Programmers. In case of Collection Use treeset

    e.

        
                                 Arrays                                 |               Collections
                                                                        |
        1. Performance wise Array is good.                              |    1. Performance wise Collection is Okay
        2. Memory Wise array is bad.                                    |    2. Memory wise Collection is good.
        3. Can hold Primitives and Objects                              |    3. Can only hold Objects.
