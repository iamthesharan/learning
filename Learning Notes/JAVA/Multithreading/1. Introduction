Multitasking :Execution multiple task Simultaneously


There are two types of multitasking:
    1. Process based multitasking
    2. Thread based multitasking.

        1. Process based multitasking
            Executing several task Simultaneously where each task is a separate individual process.

            Example:
            Listening the music at the same time writing a java program
            Download a file from net at the same time

            So Process based multitasking is best suitable on OS level and not programatic level

        2. Thread based multitasking.

            JVM is an interpreter . It will always execute program one by one line by line.

            So if I write 10k lines of code. Assume that 10k line of code required 10hrs time to completion.

            So now I thought to make 1st 5k lines of code and 2nd 5k lines of code having no dependency.
            so now 5 to 6 hrs are required.

            Executing several task Simultaneously where each task is a separate independent part of the same program.
            and each independent part is called a thread.



What is the main advantage of multitaking?
    1. Improved performance
    2. Reduce the response time of the system
