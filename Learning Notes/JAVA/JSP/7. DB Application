Connection Pool Defination: present in context.xml


<Context>
    <Resource name="jdbc/web_student_tracker"    // basically its an alias for the pool
        auth="Container"                        // auth will decide how we will authenticate, here tomcat container.
        type="javax.sql.DataSource"             // DataSource is a java interface used for communicating with the pool.
            maxActive="20"                     // Max connection is 20
            maxIdle="5"                        // when there are no users in our system. we have at least 5 connection
            maxWait="10000"
            username="system" password="sharan"
            driverClassName="oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver"
            url="jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe"
    />
</Context>



Tomcat container automatically set connection pool to the servlet.
To access that we just need to use the resource annotation
