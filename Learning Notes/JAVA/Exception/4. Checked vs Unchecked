Note Every Exceptions occurs at runtime.

Checked Exception: The Exception which are checked by Compiler for Smooth Execution of the Program at runtime. These Exceptions are called Checked Exceptions.

Example:


class Test{
    public static void main(String ...args){
        PrintWriter pw=new PrintWriter("abc.txt");
        pw.println("Hello");
    }
}

So here Copiler will say that there may be a chance of FileNotFoundException. How you will handle and the Compile will throw Exception at runtime.
Compulsory We must handle the Checked Exception either by try/Catch or Throws Keyword


Unchecked Exception:
There are Some Exception which are not checked By compiler whether the programmer has handled it or not. These types of Exceptions are called Unchecked Exceptions.

Example: ArithmeticException


Fully Checked vs Partially Checked

A Checked Exceptions is Called Fully Checked if all its Child classes are checked Exception.
Example IOException, InterruptedException

A Checked Exceptions is called Partially Checked if some of its child classes are not checked Exception
