IllegalArgumentException: Child Class of RE

If we set the priority of thread other than 1 to 10, then we will get IllegalArgumentException.
t.setPriority(15);// IllegalArgumentException



V1.6:

Whatever resources we have opened at try block, Compulsory we must close it in the finally block


V1.7:
In 1.7v, whatever resources we've opened will be automatically close. This can be achieved by try with resources

    try(R){

    }
    catch(Exception e){

    }


    try(BufferReader br=new BufferReader("input.txt")){
        use br based on requirement.
    } // Once control reaches the end of try block, the resource will automatically gets closed.
    catch(IOException e){

    }


        try(
            // Note here all the Resources must be autoclosable. hence we must implements java.lang.autoclosable
            BufferReader br=new BufferReader("input.txt");
            FileReader fr=new FileReader("input.txt")
            
            ){
        use br based on requirement.
    } // Once control reaches the end of try block, the resource will automatically gets closed.
    catch(IOException e){

    }


    All Resources should be autoclosable resources. A resource is said to be autoclosable if and only if the corresponding class implements,
    autoclosable interface. All IO related resources, DB Related resources or network Related Resources or already implemented autoclosable interface.
    Being a programmer we are not required to do anything. just we should aware the point.

    autoclosable interface came in 1.7v and contains only 1 method close()


    public void close();


    All Resources which are part of try with resource block is implicitly Final.
    that means:

    try(BufferReader br=new BufferReader("input.txt")){
        br=new BufferReader("output.txt); // Invalid. We cannot perform re-assignment for final Variable.
    } 
    catch(IOException e){

    }

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Now 1.7v the below is perfectly valid

    try(R){

    }
