The Method on which the exception occurs, That method is responsible to create Exception Object
After Creating the Exception Object, This method handover the object to the JVM.
Now JVM will check that the method on which the Exception occur, has exception Handleing code?
if not --> then JVM will Terminate that method abnormally and remove the Entry from the Runtime Stack
After that JVM will check who is the caller of that method, and Go to that method and check whether the Exception Handleing code is there or not,
If not, then JVM will repeat the same process until the JVM destroys main

After the Destuction of the Main, JVM will call Default Exception Handler.
He will just handover the Exception to default Exception Handler and the Job of Default Exception handler is to print the Exception on Console.
