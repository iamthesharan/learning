For Every Thread JVM is going to creating 1 runtime Stack
class test{
    public static void main(String ...args){
        doStuff();
    }
    public static void doStuff(){
        doMoreStuff();
    }
    public static void doMoreStuff(){
        SOP("Hello");
    }
}

    Runtime Stack

Each Entry in the Runtime Stack is called Activation Record or Stack Frame. After Successful Completion of all the methods, Each methods from the tops gets destroyed 1 by 1,
