Q) Where Anonymous Inner Classes are Best Suitable?

Ans) In Gui Event Handling

example


	class MyGuiFrame extends JFrame{
		JButton J1, J2, J3, J4, J5;
		// Let us suppose we want to add specific functionality to J1;
		
		J1.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){
			public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
				//Here is the Specific Functionality
			}
		});
		
		J2.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){
			public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
				//Here is the Specific Functionality
			}
