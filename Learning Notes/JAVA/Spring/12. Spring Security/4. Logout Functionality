So to add the Logout Support, We Need to Configure our SecurityCongif File.

In the Configure (HttpSecurity) method add the Below lines.

    .and().logout.premitAll();


We are going to Send the data to the Default logout URL.
By default must use POST Method. GET method is disabled by Default
Logout URL will be handled by Spring Security Filters


Logout Process:
By Default Spring will Invalidated the users's HTTP Session and Remove Session Cookies etc.
and Send User back to your login page
And will append a ?logout parameter which we can use to show the logout message

You need to Create a Logout form also which will contain the Logout button:

	<form:form action="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/logout" method="POST">
		<input type="submit" value="Logout"/>
	</form:form>
