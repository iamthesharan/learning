How Long the Bean Lives,
How many instances are created,
How the Bean Shared?


For defining a Scope of a bean use anotation @Scope.

Ex

@Component
@Scope("Singleton")
public class TennisCoach implements Coach{
 
}


    OR
    
    
@Component
@Scope("Prototype")
public class TennisCoach implements Coach{
 
}
