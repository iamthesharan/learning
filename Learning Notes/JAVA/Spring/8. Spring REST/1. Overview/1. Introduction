So here we will build a client application that provides the whether report for the city.
For the whether report data, we are going to get from the external Service.


Below is the application Structure:

My Whether app --> Client Side App.                                                     ==========
                                                                                                 |   
Whether Service --> External Third party Service that will act as a backend Server         <======



How we connect to the Extenal Service?

    We can make Rest API class over HTTP'
    REST: Representational State Transfer.
    Its a Light Weight Approach for Communicating between the application


What Programming Languge do we use?
Any Programming Language --> REST is language Independent
No matter whatever language the Client Side application and the Server Side application is Written


What is the DataFormat?
REST application can use any Data Format
Mostly it use -->    XML and JSON.


Here we Will use Open Whether Map and Fetch the data from there
In the API Doc you will get the information how to request for the data from the URL


You can also find the various REST API on this website www.programmableweb.com and use it on your project

What do we call it?


REST API, REST Web Services, REST Services, Restful Web Services. They All mean the Same.
