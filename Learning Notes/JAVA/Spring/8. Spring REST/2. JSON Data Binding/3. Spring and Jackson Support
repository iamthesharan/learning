Spring and Jackson Support

    Whenever we are building the Spring REST application, Spring will automatically Support Jackson Integration.
    So any JSON data which is getting passed to the rest Controller, it will automatically Converted to the POJO.
    Also, Any JAVA object which is being passed from the Rest Controller, it is converted to JSON.
