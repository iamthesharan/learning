So here we will use the below JSON.
{
    "id":14,
    "Name":"Shashank Sharan",
    "Address":{
        "City":"Pune",
        "State":"Maharashtra"
    }
}

We need to Create and Address Class first with getters and Setters for the Field City and State.
after that we need to create a nested object address in side our POJO Class in our POJO Class with getters and Setters.
Finally we call the Getters method of the nested class from Driver Class.
