Spring Rest MVC provide Support for Rest.
Here we can use new Annotation @RestController
Althought It inherits from @Controller but the @RestController has support for REST Request and REST responses.

So here Spring Rest Will Automaticall Convert JAVA POJO to JSON with the help of Jackon API.
Note** for this Automatic conversion from POJO to JSON, you must specify the dependency for Jackon in pom.xml
