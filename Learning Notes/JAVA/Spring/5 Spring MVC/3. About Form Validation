Form Validation:

    For Validation, we can make the use of Java's Standard Bean Validation API.
    It defines the Metadata model and API for Entity Validation
    So this Bean Validation API is available for Server Side Applications as well as Client Side Application such as JAVAFx/ Swing Apps


    Spring Version 4 and Higher supports Bean Validation API (JSR-303)

        Validation Features Supported by Bean Validation API are:

            1. required
            2. Validate Length
            3. Validate Numbers
            4. Validate with Regular Expressions
            5. Custom Validation


        JAVA Spring Validation API is just a Specification but we still need an implementation. We needs something that Implements the Specification.
        SO here Comes the Hibernate.

        So Hibernate will Provide the JSR -303 Validation
