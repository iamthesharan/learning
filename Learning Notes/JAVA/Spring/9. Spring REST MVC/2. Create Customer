We will use the POST method here to create a new customer and to add a new Customer.

In the Application we will pass POST api/customers and in the body we will pass the firstName, lastName and Email as the Request.
Since we are creating a new Customer here so for that we will not pass the ID.

For Aceessing the Request we need Jackson, Jackson will convert Request body from JSON to POJO.

@RequestBody will be used in the method parameter which will bind the POJO to a method body.

@PostMapping("/customers")
public Customer addCustomer(@RequestBody Customer customer){
    return theCustomerService.createCustomer(customer);
}

When Sending the JSON data to Spring Rest Controllers

For Controller to process the JSON Data, need to set a HTTP Request Header
    * Content-type: application/json

So we need to configure the Rest Client to send the correct HTTP request Header and process accordingly
So here our Rest Client is Postman

For Getting the parameter from url, use @PathVariable in method parameter
