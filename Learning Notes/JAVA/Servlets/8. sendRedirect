in case of RequestDispatcher, Client don't have any idea about the servlet 2. 
It will think that browser is getting response from the Servlet 1.

but in case of sendRedirect, the Servlet 1 will send the response to client that it is redirecting to servlet 2.

So in this case, the client is sending 2 different request.

so in this case servlet will send the response to client to redirect to another servlet.:

    response.sendRedirect("Square");
    Now when you add this line in servlet 1, it will change the url to the redirected url automatically once getting the response from Servlet1
