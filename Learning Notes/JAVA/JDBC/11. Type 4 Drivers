JAVA Application <-----> Type 4 drivers <--------> DB

These Drivers can directly communicate with DB

Advantage:
* pure JAVA Driver hence platform independent
* Native protocol drivers. beacuse it uses Database vendor provided libraries
* Thin Driver --> doesnt need any component to communicate with DB 
* Only 1 Conversion hence performace is so good


limitations:

It is the Database dependent Driver
