JAVA Application  ---> Type 3 Driver  --> MiddleWare Server  --------------->DB
                                                (IDS Server
                                                INternet Database 
                                                Server)
                                                
This is why it is called Netowrk Protocol Driver, or MiddleWare Driver 


INternally Type 3 driver take support of Middleware server to communicate with database.

Advantages:

Type 3 drivers are made in JAVA. Hence it is platform independent.
Type 3 drivers doesnot directly interact with Database. Hence it is Database independent Driver


Disadvantage:

Performace is slow. Since JDBC call are converted to middleware calls. The Middleware calls are converted to DB calls
