Steps:

1. Load and Register driver class
2. Establish connection b/w JAVA application and database
3. Create Statement Object
4. Send and Execute SQL Query
5. Process result from result set.
6. close connection


Driver Softwares are present in the form of JAR files. So we need to Place this Jar File in Class Path.
Every Driver Software is identified with some special class called Driver Class. We have to load and Register this class


1. Load and Register driver class
 
    You can load any class in java by using
    Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver"); // for type1
    
    
    Ex 
            class student{
                static{
                    SOP("Sharan");
                }
            }
            public class test{
                public static void main(String ...args){
                    Class.forName("student");
                }
            }
            
            O/P: Sharan
            
            
    So in this case internally what is happening
    
    class JdbcOdbcDriver{
        static{
            JdbcOdbcDriver driver=new JdbcOdbcDriver();
            DriverManager.registerDriver(driver);
        }
    } 
    
    So when we load this class, inside Static block will be responsible to load the driver calass and register the DriverManager.
    
    For type 1 Driver this Driver class  is present inside JDK --> JRE --> lib --> rt.jar
    
2.  Establishing a Connection:
    
    // DriverManager Class has get Connection Method 
    DriverManager.getConnection();
    
    inside getConnection Method: JDBC URL is required to connect DB. means DB host name, Username and Password.
    Then only DriverManager will provide Connection Object.
    
    Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection(JDBC_URL, Username, password);
    
    JDBC URL Syntax:
    
    
    mainProtocol:   subProtocol:        subname
         |              |                   |
         |              |                   |
        jdbc        Driver Protocol     Connection details
    (it will        varry from driver
    always be       to driver
    JDBC)           and connection to 
                    connection
                    
    Therefore for Type 1: jdbc:odbc:demodsn
    
    Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:odbc:demodsn", "scott", "tiger");
    
    
    Hence for Type 1 driver DNS will provide Database info to ODBC Driver. Example DB Name
    DSN is only Required for type1 driver.

    DSN Types:
    1. User DSN
    2. System DSN
    3. File DSN




    Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection(JDBC_URL, Username, password);

    **NOTE: Connection is an Interface. When the DriverManager returns Connection Object, the object is of type sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcConnection.

    you can check by. con.getClass().getName();

3.  Creation of Statement object

    Statement st=con.createStatement();
    
    
    
4.  Send and Execute SQL Query

    There are two types of Query:
    1. Select Query: return ResultSet Objects
    2. Non Select Query: returns numeber. Number of rows inserted, deleted, updated etc.
    
    
    For Executing the query in JDBC, three methods are there:
    1.executeQuery();
    2.executeUpdate();
    3.execute();
    
    These methods are defined in Statement Interface
