Type 2 Drivers are same as Type 1 Driver except here ODBC Driver is replaced with Database Vendor Native Libraries

JAVA Application  <---->  Type 2 Driver  <----> Vendor Provided Database  <----> DB
                                                    Specific Libraries
                                                        (Native Driver)
                                                        
Type 2 Drivers: the Driver that converts JDBC Calls to Vaendor Specific native Driver are called Type 2 Driver.

Native Libraries: The libraries that are developed in NON JAVA mostly C/C++

Advantages

Type 2 Driver is Faster than type 1 Since only JDBC calls are converted to DATABASE SPECIFIC Native library CAlls that can be understood by DB


Disadvantage:
1. Database Dependent
2. Platform Dependent -->  Diffrent For diffrent OS


Which Jar to use?

Oracle 10g( internally Uses java 1.4)   --> ojdbc14.jar
Oracle 11g ( internally uses java 6v)  --> ojdbc6.jar
Oracle 12g ( internally uses java 7v)  --> ojdbc7.jar
