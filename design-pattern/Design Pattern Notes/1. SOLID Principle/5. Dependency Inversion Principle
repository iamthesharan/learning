A High Level Modules Should Not Depend on Low Level Modules, Both Should Depened on abstraction.

Abstraction Should not depend upon details. Details Should Depends upon Abstraction.


Dependency:
Dependency is something we need in order to provide the functionality that we are writing code for.


High Level Module: the Module Which has Main Business Logic.
Low Level Module: The module which has very samll functionality like writing to disk etc.
So High Level Module Should not depend on low level module.


Example:
public void viewReport(){
    Report report=new Report();
    Formatter formatter=new Formatter();
    String report=formatter.format(report);
    FileWriter writer=new FileWriter("Report.txt");
    writer.write("My Report");
}


Suppose  We want to write in HTML Format but the Above method is for writing in File.
--->
public void viewReport(Formatter formatter, Writer writer){
    Report report=new Report();
    String report=formatter.format(report);
    writer.write("My Report");
}
