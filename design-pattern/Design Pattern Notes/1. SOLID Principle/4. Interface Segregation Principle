Clients Shouldn't have to depend on interfaces that they don't use.

Interface pollution: We should not make our interface bigger with methods which are unreated to the Iterface.


When Do we have Violations of this Priniple:
1. Classes Have Empty method Implementation
2. Method Implementation thows UnsupportedOperationException (or Similar)
3. Method Implementation return null or Default/dummy Values.


Suppose an interface has methods which are not applicable for the particular class. There there are 3 Options left for the client:
1. Implement that methods with Some Dummy Value
2. Implement the method by returning null
3. Implement the method by throw new UnsupportedOperationException("");
