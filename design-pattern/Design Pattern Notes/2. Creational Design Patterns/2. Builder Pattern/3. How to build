The Builder Pattern is a design pattern which is a set of classes and/or interfaces meant to organize complex code

Steps for Creating a builder:
1. Study the object that we need to build our builder for. The goal is to find out the parts or objects that are needed by our final object.
2. Once you find out these parts we will provide methods in builder for each one of these parts
3. Provide Methods that assembles or build our final Object.
4. Provide a methods to get the finally built object outside. Optionally builder can keep reference to an product it has built so that same can be returned in future again.

A Director:
Director is rarely implemented as a separate class. Clients themselves plays the role of the Director. Client know how to use the builder that we have provided.

In General, You should keep Builder Code in Inner Class inside Product Class which is a good Approach.
