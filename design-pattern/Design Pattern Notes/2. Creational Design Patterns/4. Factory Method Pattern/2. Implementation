Creator:
Creator itself can be a concrete class if it can provide a default object in it's factory method or it can be Abstract.
Implementation will override the method and return the object.


The Creator can be a concrete class & provide a default Implementation for the factory method. 
In such cases you'll create some default object in base creator


You can also use the simple factory way of accepting additional arguments to choose between different object types.
Subclasses can then override factory method to selectively create different object for some criteria.
