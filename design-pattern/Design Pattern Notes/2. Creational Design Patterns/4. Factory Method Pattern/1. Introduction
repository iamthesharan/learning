Whenever we want to move our object creation logic which may be spread throughout our code and encapsulate that in a separate class, we can use factory method.

What is Factory Method?
Whenever we use this pattern we don't have to know which class we are going to instantiate before hand.
i.e we can keep adding new classes that needs to be instantiated and our factory method will handle that without requiring any change to client code.

How Factory Mehtod Achieve this?
By Delegating the object creation to subclasses.


Classes and interfaces:

Product - Base class or interface of products created by factory Method.
ConcreteProductA- Implements Product
ConcreteProductB- Implements Product
ConcreteProductC- Implements Product


Creator - This is where Factory method Design pattern start to be implemented.
- Declares the Abstract Factory method.
- Additionally uses the factory method to create product.

ConcreteCreatorA: - Overrides the factory method from Creator.
ConcreteCreatorB: - Overrides the factory method from Creator.
